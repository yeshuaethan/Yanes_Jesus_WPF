//I currently work as an Implementations Engineer. I work on Web Deployments, application upgrades, and code migrations amongst other things.
//Assuming that you can get all the Web Deployments you need done in 2 hrs.
//Typical job has 9-5 work time, 40 hr week work time. (Say there's 4 weeks in a month)
//You take a total of an hour break a day, which sums to 5 hrs a week.
//How many Web Deployments can be finished in a month?
