//Since I'm a gym freak and solely depend on protein shakes, I decided to do a protein powder calculator.
//I need to find out the amount of protein powder needed on a monthly basis.
//I will make a calculator for fitness enthusiast that calculates the amount of protein powder needed on a monthly basis.
//This can probably be used to calculate any brand of protein powder out there.

//Example:
//I will tell you how much protein powder you consume in cups, per months you put in. (You will have convert cups to pounds yourself.)
//Taking into account that there are 4 weeks in a month and also the amount of days in a week that you workout (Example: 5).
//How much protein powder do I need every months?

/*
var dailyConsumption = 1;
var consumptionAmount = 2;
var months = 5;
var amount = 1 * 2;
var monthTotal = (5 * amount) * 2;
var neededPeriod = monthTotal * months;

console.log(neededPeriod);
