// Conditional Logic

var kidHeight = 50;
var minHeight = 38;

//if the child is old enough, print to the console "you can ride!"
//if the kid is over 48 inches in height
if(kidHeight > minHeight){
    //code performed if condition is true
    console.log("You can ride the roller coaster!");
}else{
    console.log("You cannot ride the roller coaster!");
